I started this project as I wanted to use the same documentation process for my
Perl code as I do for all the other code I write.  Obviously the Perl "way" of 
documenting is to use POD, and while POD is great for small Perl projects in 
general, it does not in my opinion, provide a good tool for documenting large 
interconnected projects and frameworks.

Doxygen does not currently support Perl natively so the only way to get Doxygen
to support Perl is to pre-filter the Perl code and Perl comments in to a format
that Doxygen can handle. This requires reading and parsing through the code and
creating Java-Doc or C/C++ style comments out of the code.

This project (Doxygen::Filter::Perl) represents completely new code based on the 
original work from the project DoxyGen::Filter written by Bart Schuller of Phinex 
Informatik AG and Thomas Aeby of Phinex Informatik AG. While this is all new code,
credit for the concept and idea needs to go to Bart and Thomas. It is also important
to note that I am taking over the DoxyGen::Filter project and further work of that
code by permission from Thomas Aeby.

A lot of users have contributed code and code ideas to this project and we welcome
all future ideas and code submissions. One of the largest contributors of ideas 
and code comes from Kieron Taylor of the The European Bioinformatics Institute and 
Genome Research Limited.

Special thanks goes to Zbynek Vyskovsky for the many patches, ideas, and features
to help make this project more complete and allow developers to take advantage of
nearlly all of the doxygen commands.
