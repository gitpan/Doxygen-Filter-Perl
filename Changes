v0.99_01 - Initial Alpha Release (2011-10-21)
    Differences from DoxyGenFilter
        This represents a complete rewrite of the code and attempts to provide 
        a frame work from which we can greatly expand the functionality over time.
        We also build up a document object of the code that allows us to pull things
        in from various places and relate them all correctly. 

    New Features
        We current support the following doxygen structural indicators
            @file
            @fn (@function and @method)
        All section indicators should work under each structural indicators that we support
        Verbatim formatting keeps comment "#" tags
        We use the VERSION variable from the code in the file output definition
        The @method and @function documentation blocks can reside inside or outside
            the actual subroutines that they are tied to.

    Known Issues
        POD support is not yet included
        Only two structural indicators are currently supported - more to come
